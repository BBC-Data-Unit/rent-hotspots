People spend more than a third of their disposable income on rent across large parts of England, [a BBC investigation has found](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36794222).

The BBC England data unit analysed the average rents for different types of property in each local authority area and the median weekly wage for those areas, using figures published by the Office for National Statistics. These figures were then analysed against guidance that spending more than a third of your disposable income on rent or a mortgage means you may not be able to afford other basic needs.

The reporting team spoke to the Residential Landlords Associaton, the National Housing Federation, Shelter, the [Generation Rent](http://www.generationrent.org/) campaign, a lettings agency in Cumbria (which came out as one of the most 'affordable' places to live), and the Department of Communities and Local Government, and interviewed people struggling to get on the housing ladder.
